## Time series analysis and modeling to predict ground-level concentration of NO2

In recent years, the air quality has been getting worse due to the increasing emission of air pollutants from human activities and environmental changes. This project presents time series analysis and modeling to predict the ground-level concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) â€“ one of 6 criteria air pollutants identified by United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose is to provide useful information and forecast the future concentration of the air pollutant, which would help governments and authorities to make appropriate plans and solutions to protect the air quality.
